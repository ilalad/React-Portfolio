                Hi, my name is Harpreet. I am on my way to becoming a Web
                Developer learning and living in Houston, Texas. I'm currently
                working on mastering Rice University's Coding Bootcamp Program.
                While I'm learning new skills I enjoy implementing them into my
                new projects. My experiences include developing webpages using
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootsrap. Hobbies away from the
                web world, I enjoy cooking, traveling and sightseeing.
